As a developer, it is very important to know how to request and obtain Permissions in Android development.  Permissions Companion is an app that allowed me to learn most about Permissions.

Permissions Companion App has components that can be started only with many permission:<br>

ğŸ†— Services, Activities and Receivers that be started only with custom run time permission.
